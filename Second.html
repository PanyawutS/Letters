                        <strong>Dear Whan.</strong>
                        <p>
                            I'll wait here. You might think my waiting is in vain, but it's okay. I'm willing to wait. No matter how things turn out, let it be. My heart is steady and strong, but not strong enough to see you sad.
                            I'm really glad and happy to have met you. Keep smiling and stay bright. Take good care of your heart. And one thing I will never allow is for anyone to hurt you again. 
                            When the time comes, whether I'm the one standing there or someone else is, I'll always wish you happiness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This just a part of my heart that I wanted to share with you.
                            See you soon, my wonderful and lovely one.  Panyawut
