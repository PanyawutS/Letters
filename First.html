                        <strong>Dear Whan.</strong>
                        <p>
                            These days, I know we haven't talked much. Honestly, I want to talk a lot and see you so much. But when I hear your voice, I end up not knowing what to say, so I have to express it through writing instead. 
                            You've been spending a lot of time with your friends and yourself lately, wish you be happy with them. That will makes me happy too. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Live your life to the fullest. When you're happy, you don't need to think of me, but if you ever feel sad, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you. 
                            You can tell me anything and call me anytime, and I'll come to you as quickly as I can.
                        </p>
